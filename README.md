# PhoneBook---1st-Project

* This was my First project.
* Build a simple phoneBook Application using C++ only.
#### UserDefined function 
## Got()
#### Got() over cin()
* Cin() stop reading a string after space but got() continues to read string even after space.
* Got() stops reading the string only after seeing a new line character.
* The entered character is immediately returned without waiting for the enter key.
* Got() does not use any buffer to store the input character.
